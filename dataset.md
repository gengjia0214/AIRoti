# THE ROTIFER DATASET

## Why Care About How Rotifer Look?

The feeds for rotifer cultivation usually consist of high protein and lipid contents,
which are essential for fish larval development.
Appropriate feeding rate is important for rotifer culture as well as the health of fish larvae.
Underfeeding could lead to insufficient capsulation of nutrients or even declined rotifer population.
Overfeeding could lead to deteriorated water quality and pathogenic bacteria development, 
which are detrimental for rotifers as well as the fish larvae.

Rotifers have a short lifespan (7-10 days) but can reproduce every 4-8 hours. 
Hence, the rotifer population, especially in commercial scale culture, is highly dynamic.
The feeding rate must be decided by not only the current population but also the fertilization rate.
For fish farmers, one of the most important know-how is to be able to recognize 
the fertilized rotifer and un-fertilized rotifer ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). 

Egg-carrying (fertilized) rotifer and non-egg-carrying (unfertilized) rotifer can be easily recognized with human eyes.
However, it becomes tedious and inefficient when hundreds of rotifers under the microscope need to be recognized.
For commercial scale fish farm where many different batches of rotifer culture are maintained at the same time, 
a live feed specialist could spend hours just in counting the rotifer samples.

Another important evaluation on the rotifer culture is the "dirtiness".
The "dirtiness" is reflected by the presents of the detritus and ciliates in the rotifer samples 
and is assessed based on live feed specialists' observation and experience. 
When a live feed specialist determine the rotifer culture is "too dirty", a reset (like dialysis) process will be executed. 
The whole rotifer culture will be washed through a mesh 
that can retain the rotifers but let the smaller detritus and ciliates pass through. 
A reset can purify the rotifer culture but it could also wash away the rotifer eggs, 
which will compromise the population growth.
