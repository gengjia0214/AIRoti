## PROJECT BACKGROUND

The global fish consumption has increased by over 100% in the past half decade.
Aquaculture currently contributes more than 50% to the global food-use fish production and is expected to continue
growing. 
Rotifer, a crucial starting diet for fish larvae, is critical for fish aquaculture. 
However, the cultivation of rotifer is labor intensive. 
Automated rotifer culture is one of the necessary and critical piece of next generation aquaculture.

## PROJECT BLOGs

### BLOG#1 - A Glimpse of the Dataset

The rotifer dataset is consisted of microscopic images and videos of rotifer culture samples, collected and
annotated by skillful rotifer culture specialists at the University of Miami Experimental Hatchery. 
The dataset is prepared for training classic machine learning algorithms as well as the deep learning models to
achieve the project objectives.

### BLOG#2 - Moving Object Detection and Patch Classification

Moving object detection algorithm is able to  efficiently generate object proposals. The proposed patches can then be
classified by well-trained object classifier into classes of interests.
