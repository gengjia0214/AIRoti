# PROTEIN FROM THE OCEANS

<br />
_"Weâ€™ll need to farm the seas to survive in a crowded world. But the challenge will be to do it right."_ 

_- Bryan Walsh_

With the growing of the population and the appetite for protein from the sea, the oceans are under pressure more than
ever. The current world fish consumption is more than twice as much as it was 50 years ago ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). We
urgently need to find a sustainable way to harvest protein from the oceans.

According to The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) 2018 by the Food and Agriculture Organization
, aquaculture contributed 53% of global food-use fish production and it is expected to be responsible for the
continuing impressive growth in the supply of fish for human consumption as the capture fishery production
relatively static since the late 1980s ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).

Aquaculture is an efficient way of producing protein as it has lower Feed Coversion Ratio (FCR, Feed Given/Animal
Weight Gain) compare to other livestock such as beef cattle, pigs and chickens ([Fig. 3](#fig3)). Fish farmers raise
fish from eggs to market size ([Fig. 4](#fig4)). In the fish's "life cycle", the feeds is the most important
element. Fish at different stages requires suitable feeds of different sizes and nutritional profiles. __RotiferS
, also called wheel animals, are the mostly commonly used starting diet for fish larvae.__

# ROTIFER - TINY BUT SIGNIFICANT

Fish larvae at early stage can only feed on small particles (< 200 um). Rotifers, _Brachionus spp._, are crucial
starting diet for fish aquaculture because of their suitable size (50~150 um), adequate nutrition profile when
properly enriched, and their bio-encapsulation ability. Fish larval production usually requires a continuous supply of
live rotifers in large quantities. For example, producing 1000 40 Day-Post-Hatch (DPH) red snapper fingerlings will
need a supply of at least 500 millions rotifers. __Before raising fish, fish farmers must raise the rotifers.__
